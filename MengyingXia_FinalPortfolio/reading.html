        <h2>Ulises Carrión - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Date: Sep 6th, 2023</p>
        <p>
            The reading challenges misconceptions about Mail Art being easy, cheap, and unpretentious, highlighting the creative complexities involved. The concept of measuring Mail Art's success by the harmony of responses prompts reflection on the essence of artistic communication, which offers a thought-provoking perspective on the intersection of art and postal communication, sparking curiosity about the boundaries and possibilities of Mail Art. I'm also curious about how might the evolving digital landscape and the decline of traditional postal communication affect the future of Mail Art as an artistic medium? (Does this kind of leading into the progress of Web Art?)

        <h2>Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</h2>
        <p>Date: Sep 11, 2023</p>
        <p>
            It was intriguing to read how the author highlights the idea that nothing exists in isolation and advocates for forming personal connections between various texts and ideas. Building one's reading networks is seen as a means to create personal abstractions, establish relevance to topics, and enhance the consumption of others' ideas. Isolating concepts leads to a loss of meaning and discomfort, preferring an approach that breaks down cognitive boundaries and avoids linear thinking. Instead, encouraging a more networked and interconnected approach to learning can foster creativity, critical thinking, and a deeper appreciation for the complexity of the world around us.

        <h2>Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</h2>
        <p>Date: Sep 18, 2023</p>
        <p>
            This week's reading highlights the distinction between print and digital, emphasizing the physicality of print and its unique role as both carrier and display. The discussion about print's transformation into valuable collector's items aligns with my observations of how people cherish physical books and magazines in an increasingly digital world, and the mention of DIY publishing and its offline networks is a testament to the enduring appeal of print and the creative potential it still holds. The rise of e-publishing is an inevitable trend, but the author rightly points out that its true power lies in networking capabilities. The idea of universal interoperability standards in digital publishing is crucial to avoid locking consumers into closed ecosystems. Lastly, I found the concept of true hybrids, where distinctions between print and digital blur, is exciting. It sparks curiosity about the possibilities for innovative content creation and the potential for entirely new publishing paradigms in the future.

        <h2>Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</h2>
        <p>Date: Sep 24, 2023</p>
        <p>
            This week's reading provides a glimpse into the preservation and aging of web content, mainly focusing on the Geocities pages from the late 90s.  It was intriguing to read the preservation efforts and challenges faced by the Archive Team in saving a significant portion of Geocities, noting the loss of certain elements and the lasting impact of this closure on the broader web. Meanwhile, the visual aesthetics of these aging web pages emphasize the distinctive features of bordered backgrounds and the nostalgia associated with the design elements from that era. It also contemplates the web's perpetual youthfulness and its unique ability to transcend traditional notions of aging.

        <h2>Seth Price - Dispersion</h2>
        <p>Date: Oct 1, 2023</p>
        <p>
            The discussion about the evolution of public art and its place in today's culture from this week's reading is both thought-provoking and timely. The concept of collective experience now relies heavily on private experiences that occur simultaneously across various forms of media. This interconnectedness through ongoing debate, publicity, promotion, and discussion reshapes our understanding of what it means to experience art in a public context. The argument that a popular album or website can be more successful as a form of public art than a physical monument highlights the changing dynamics of public engagement with art, which prompts us to reevaluate our understanding of public art in the digital age. It challenges us to think beyond traditional monuments and embrace the potential of art distributed through various media as a means of engaging with a broader audience and sparking meaningful discussions about our society and culture.

        <h2>Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</h2>
        <p>Date: Oct 13, 2023</p>
        <p>
            The concept of framing alt-text as a form of poetry is intriguing and aligns with the idea of enhancing web accessibility. Coklyat and Finnegan's emphasis on the careful choice of language and brevity in alt-text is particularly valuable, considering that concise descriptions are often more effective. The emphasis on language, tone, and brevity resonates with me, as it underscores the importance of crafting descriptions that are both expressive and efficient. The notion of an "experimental spirit" in alt-text creation is also appealing, as it encourages a more playful and open-minded approach, fostering the potential for more inclusive and engaging web content. This week's reading has made me realize that alt-text creation can be an art form in itself, enhancing the accessibility and overall user experience of digital content.

        <h2>Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s)</h2>
        <p>Date: Oct 21, 2023</p>
        <p>
            This week's reading delves in to the intriguing concept of hypermodernism in graphic design and its utilization of symbols and signifiers. What stands out to me is how it uses Disney icons and typography as an example of this trend within certain circles of graphic design: how Disney motifs are frequently used by designers and design studios engaged in critical graphic design, a practice that challenges traditional client-designer relationships and focuses on critical investigation and speculative work. In this context, Disney imagery is used as a semiotic language to engage in critical dialogue. Designers harness Disney iconography as a symbol of market-driven art and the homogenizing forces of capitalism. They use Disney's recognizable symbols to convey a critique of capitalism and globalization. The text also highlights how contemporary designers often don't alter Disney imagery but utilize its existing associations to imply critique. It's fascinating how Disney, a symbol of American culture, has become a symbol of the very forces it represents, and it's a thought-provoking exploration of how design reflects and responds to the evolving socio-cultural landscape.

        <h2>Ramsey Nasser - "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</h2>
        <p>Date: Oct 28, 2023</p>
        <p>
            This week's reading delves into the issue of linguistic bias in computer programming, particularly focusing on the pervasive influence of the English language in the field. It highlights the complex interplay between keywords (inherent in programming languages) and identifiers (names chosen by users) and how English terminology permeates both of these aspects. The author's experiment with developing a non-English programming language, which vividly illustrates the formidable challenges of breaking free from the English-centric programming landscape. The reading's exploration of the cultural and linguistic intricacies in programming, emphasizing the significance of naming conventions, underscores the immense difficulty of achieving a genuinely non-English programming experience due to the deeply rooted dominance of the English language. I found this point really provoking that prompts readers to contemplate the future of programming and the potential for a more inclusive and equitable approach to address linguistic diversity.

        <h2>Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</h2>
        <p>Date: Nov 12, 2023</p>
        <p>
            I find it interesting how Vera Frenkel, with her 1974 "String Games" and later the "Body Missing" website, predicted how technology would affect our memories. The use of Xs to mark participants in "String Games" now seems like a sign of upcoming loss in our current connected world. Frenkel's idea that screens can make things disappear makes us rethink how we see virtual connections and remember things. Her use of technology makes us think more about screens, not just as places to keep things, but also as reminders of the things we've lost in our history.

        <h2>Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed</h2>
        <p>Date: Nov 20, 2023</p>
        <p>
            This week's reading makes me think about how the way we share information has transformed, from clear substrates to this open, fluid space. I appreciated the insights into authorship, the shift to syntax-based curation, and the challenges posed by algorithms. Real-world examples, like the Paradise Papers, made it all feel relevant. The idea of printing bots to interrupt the flow of information was particularly intriguing. The reading ends with a call to rethink how we engage with feeds, urging us to find new ways to interact with digital content. It got me thinking about how I navigate information in the tech-driven world nowadays.

        <h2>Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</h2>
        <p>Date: Nov 26, 2023</p>
        <p>
            This week's reading talked about technology, history, and community in a way that I felt relatable. Gem's story in "The Way" reminded me of my own experiences online, making me think a lot about how technology can have biases and influence who we are as individuals and as a group. Gem's recognition that computers embody societal influences, particularly in the master/slave relationship, made me reconsider my own interactions with technology, serving as a reflection on the hidden biases in our digital world.

        <h2>Hito Steyerl - Why Games Or Can Art Workers Think</h2>
        <p>Date: Dec 4, 2023</p>
        <p>
            This week's reading suggests that, for the majority of humanity, war might be preferable if it were akin to a video game where casualties are temporary and players can respawn. The narrative delves into the historical context of Alan Turing's thought experiment on whether machines can think and how this led to the development of modern digital computers, emphasizing their role as rational game players. I found the reading particularly intriguing in a way that it prompts reflection on the impact of games and simulations on real-world scenarios, challenging conventional notions of rationality, and revealing the evolving relationship between technology and human experience.
